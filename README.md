# Zig-Coreutils

A Zig implementation of common UNIX command-line utilities.

> [!CAUTION]
> **_work in progress_** - it may contains bugs, unoptimized implementations or stubs instead of real functionalities. 

## Overview

This project aims to implement core UNIX/Linux utilities in Zig, providing safe and efficient alternatives to traditional coreutils. The implementation focuses on POSIX compliance while leveraging Zig's safety features and modern programming practices.

## Features

- Safe file I/O operations with proper error handling
- POSIX-compliant implementations
- Modern Zig-based approach to system utilities
- Comprehensive error reporting
